// Introduction to Linked Lists
// A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a group of nodes where each node point to the next node through a pointer. Each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence.

//  Linked List

//  Linked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures. The principal benefits of a linked list over a conventional array are:

// The list elements can easily be inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure because the data items need not be stored contiguously in memory. Simultaneously, an array has to be declared in the source code before compiling and running the program.
// Linked lists allow the insertion and removal of nodes at any point in the list. They can do so with a constant number of operations if the link to the previous node is maintained during the list traversal.
// On the other hand, simple linked lists by themselves do not allow random access to the data or any form of efficient indexing. Thus, many basic operations – such as obtaining the last node of the list, finding a node containing a given data, or locating the place where a new node should be inserted – may require sequential scanning of most or all of the list elements.
